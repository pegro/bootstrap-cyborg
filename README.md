Bootstrap
=========

Shim repository for the Cyborg [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).

This package just provides the Cyborg Bootswatch theme for Bootstrap. Since
Bootstrap themes ship the entire CSS to be replaced with Bootstrap's, this will
facilitate the use with the Cyborg Bootstrap theme.
